# Asteroids

## Introduction
Asteroids is my second game using SDL2 with C++. I explored fonts using SDL_ttf and used the random library to render stars continuosly to make it look like they are blinking.

## Main page

Players can press the key p to begin playing.

## Game

Players are to use the left and right keys to move the spaceship to avoid colliding with the asteroid. The score is tracked on the top right corner.

## End

Upon collision with the asteroid, the game ends and the score is shown. The player can also press the key r to replay the game.

## Remarks
Learnt how to use SDL_ttf with online fonts. Using images as sprites have the con of not having a fixed shape, this makes the collisions to be inaccurate in some scenarios.
